This Github page contains resources for use in a text-as-data workshop in economics at the University of Exeter on June 22.

For this workshop I'll be working through some tools in Python 3, specifically Python 3.9. If you haven't used Python before, I like using the PyCharm IDE (integrated development environment). The community version is freely available, and has lots of nice easy-to-use features. It's available here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Once you've got Python installed and ready to go, there are a few packages we'll go through that you need to install. There are a few basic general-use Python libraries you'll need to install:

  #. pandas
  #. numpy
  #. matplotlib
  #. statsmodels

Then some more natural language processing or machine learning specific packages:

  #. sklearn
  #. nltk
  #. vaderSentiment
