Text-As-Data Workshop

**Uni Exeter Econ, June 22, 2022**

This Github page contains resources for use in a text-as-data workshop in economics at the University of Exeter on June 22.

For this workshop I'll be working through some tools in Python 3, specifically Python 3.9. If you haven't used Python before, I like using the PyCharm IDE (integrated development environment). The community version is freely available, and has lots of nice easy-to-use features. It's available here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Once you've got Python installed and ready to go, there are a few packages we'll go through that you need to install. There are a few basic general-use Python libraries you'll need to install:

  #. pandas
  #. numpy
  #. matplotlib
  #. statsmodels

Then some more natural language processing or machine learning specific packages:

  #. sklearn
  #. nltk
  #. vaderSentiment

If you're using PyCharm installing these is easy to do. In the bottom-right corner of the screen it will says something like "Python 3.9" to tell you which Python interpreter PyCharm is using. If you click on this, then on "Interpreter Settings" in the menu that pops up, it will list the packages installed. At the bottom of this list there will be a "+" symbol that allows you to install new packages. If you click the "+" button, it will bring up a list of available packages, and you can search by name for the packages listed above, and it will automatically install for you.
